<h4>
Let's talk about Tor interface and security Features
</h4>
<p>
Using TorBrowser is easy, it has friendly interface and doesn't require too much technical skills. You can use it on almost any Operating System. If any website requires features that track you then TorBrowser will show you precaution. I recommend you to use TorBrowsers default settings. In lef top side you can see Onion button which show that tor is enable, there you can change Identity, switch to new tor circuits etc.
New identity gives you new IP address.
On security settings it by default stays on low but if you move to middle it will disable JavaScript on non HTTPS protected websites.

Keep that in mind such network connection slows your network
