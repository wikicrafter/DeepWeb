### PGP = Pretty Good Privacy 

> PGP is a encryption program 
> PGP is a cryptographic method that lets people communicate privately online
<p>When u send message using PGP, the message is converted to unreadable cipher text
on your device before it passes through the internet. Only the recipient has the key to convert it back into the readable message on the device </p>

<p>PGP is the best way to encrypt online messages.
Used to encrypt and emails, text files, and images.
It is used on Deep Web to share information that is sensitive/private.

> It is the closes to military-grade encryption

> How those it works? 
> For instance: Meet Elis and Bob
> * Elis writes a message:"Hello Bob" and encrypts with Bob's public key
> * He sends encrypted message on to the evil World Wide Web: "#aZx3G1!/* 
> * Bob decrypts the message with private key (message: "Hello Bob")
