#### How to host it by your own machine?

> I suggest to use Linux distributions if you are trying to host websites on the DeepWeb

* Go to the root on terminal:
* install tor through terminal:
* go to the next folder: cd /etc
* then move to: cd tor
* check what u have there for that type: ls
* there will be file called: torrc 
* edit it with editor like a nano, vim, gedit or any other one u choose
* for instance i'll use gedit to open it type: gedit torrc
* get rid of 2 lines at the bottom lines 
* after that type there: HiddenServiceDir /var/lib/tor/hidden_service
* the go to the next line and type: HiddenServicePort 80 192.168.2.5:80 (type your IP)
* then exit
* on terminal form dir root@yourusername:/etc/tor# type:  service tor start 
* then install apache web server: install apache2
* then type: service apache2 start 
* then open explorer and go to the var directory, next: lib, next: tor 
* after that go to: hidden_service and open your host name you will see there onion link
* then:go again to var dir then www dir then html dir the index.html is siurce code of your website 
* then open TorBrowser and type your onion domain there 
* That's it
