### So here I'll describe what's a Deep Web?
### What's a dark web?
### What is a clear web?

> The deep web, invisible web, or hidden web is part of the World Wide Web whose content are not indexed by standard search engine for any reason 
> It estimated that the deep web makes up 96% of the whole internet 

>The term of deep web and dark web are often used interchangeably, but they are not the same. Deep web simply refers to anything on the web that can't be found using a search engine. 

<h4>Difference between Clear and Deep Web?</h4>
<p>The surface web is every site we use everyday, for instance: Google, DuckDuckGo, Startpage etc. Anything you can access through a link</p>

<p>The deep web contains things that are private, and anything that requires  pass some security functions like a: authentication to access that data. For instance: Facebook, Twitter, Any cloud storage that requires authentication and so on (Deep web information isn't accessed by web crawlers)</p>

<p>The dark web contains things that are purposely hidden, not necessarily for security , and requires special software to access</p>
