### System Inquiry: What is the Deep Web?

> **Query Result**: The deep web (invisible web) refers to all parts of the World Wide Web not indexed by standard search engines.
> **Statistics**: Estimated to be **400-500 times larger** than the surface web, comprising ~96% of all internet data.

#### [LAYER 1] The Surface Web (Clear Web)
*   **Accessibility**: Licensed drivers only. Publicly indexed.
*   **Examples**: Google, Wikipedia, Reddit, Amazon.
*   **Visibility**: Full. Traceable.

#### [LAYER 2] The Deep Web
*   **Accessibility**: authorized access only.
*   **Content**:
    *   Dynamic pages returned in response to queries.
    *   Private databases (Medical records, Legal documents).
    *   Academic research and scientific reports.
    *   Social media data behind login screens.
*   **Analogy**: If the Surface Web is the tip of the iceberg, the Deep Web is the massive mountain of ice beneath the water.

#### [LAYER 3] The Dark Web (Darknet)
*   **Accessibility**: Special tunneling software required (Tor, I2P, Freenet).
*   **Protocol**: Non-standard (e.g., `.onion` top-level domains).
*   **Characteristics**:
    *   **Anonymity**: User IP addresses are masked.
    *   **Encryption**: Traffic is encrypted through multiple nodes.
    *   **Services**: Whistleblowing (SecureDrop), evasion of censorship, black markets.

> [!NOTE]
> **Technical Distinction**: All "Dark Web" content is technically "Deep Web" (unindexed), but not all "Deep Web" content is "Dark Web".

### [ TIPS & TRICKS ]
*   **Terminology**: Don't look like a "noob". Never say "Mariana Web" (it's a hoax involving quantum computers).
*   **Mindset**: Treat the Dark Web like a generic unlit alleyway. It's not inherently evil, but you should be aware of your surroundings.
