### PANIC PROTOCOLS

**Scenario: The Knock at the Door**
If law enforcement is at your door, you have seconds.
1.  **Shut Down**: If you are using Tails, **RIP OUT THE USB STICK**. The RAM will fade in seconds/minutes.
2.  **Power Off**: If using Veracrypt, power off the PC. Encryption keys reside in RAM.

**Duress Passwords:**
*   Veracrypt allows a "Hidden Volume".
*   **Outer Password**: Decrypts a "Decoy" OS with innocent files (cat photos).
*   **Inner Password**: Decrypts the "Hidden" OS with the sensitive data.
*   If forced to give a password, give the Outer one. PGP can't verify if a hidden volume exists.

**Dead Man's Switch:**
A system that publishes (or deletes) data if you fail to check in after X days. Useful for journalists in dangerous zones.

### [ TIPS & TRICKS ]
*   **Disable FaceID/TouchID**: Police can force your finger onto a sensor or hold a phone to your face. They cannot legally force you to say a password (in some jurisdictions like the US video creates complex legal nuance, but a password is generally protected by the 5th Amendment).
*   **Full Disk Encryption (FDE)**: Always. Everywhere. Even on your phone.
