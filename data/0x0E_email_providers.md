### Secure Communication (Email)

**Provider Analysis:**

*   **ProtonMail**:
    *   *Pros*: Easy, mostly secure.
    *   *Cons*: Logs IP addresses if forced by Swiss courts (unless you use their .onion site). Requires JS.
*   **Elude**:
    *   *Pros*: Privacy-focused, no JS required, free.
*   **Mail2Tor**:
    *   *Pros*: Only works on Tor.
    *   *Cons*: Often down or flagged as spam by other providers.

### [ TIPS & TRICKS ]
*   **PGP is King**: Never rely on the email provider's encryption ("End-to-End" implies you trust their code). **Always Encrypt the message locally** with GPG before pasting it into the email body.
*   **Burner Accounts**: Use [TempMail](https://temp-mail.org/) for registering on forums if you don't care about account recovery.
*   **Subject Lines**: Remember, PGP **does not encrypt the Subject Line**. Keep it generic (e.g., "Hello" or "Project Update").
