### The Immutable Ledger & Tracking

**What is Chainalysis?**
Companies like *Chainalysis* or *Elliptic* specialize in tracking crypto crimes. They map the blockchain.
*   If you buy drugs with BTC, and that BTC later moves to an exchange where you verified your ID, **they link the drug purchase to your ID**.

**Concept: "Tainted Coins"**
*   Exchange accounts get frozen if they receive BTC that was previously involved in hacks, markets, or gambling.
*   This is why we use **Monero (XMR)**—it breaks the link, ensuring coins are "fungible" (indistinguishable from one another).

### [ TIPS & TRICKS ]
*   **CoinJoins (Wasabi/Samourai)**: A method to mix BTC with other users. It helps, but it's not perfect and can sometimes flag your coins as "High Risk" to exchanges.
*   **Observation**: You can watch the blockchain live at `mempool.space` (Clear Web) or its onion mirror.
