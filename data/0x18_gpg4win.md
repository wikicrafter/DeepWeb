### GPG Suite for Windows

**Key Management:**
Your private key is your identity. If you lose it, you lose your reputation and ability to decrypt messages.
1.  **Backup**: Export your private key (`secring.gpg`) to a USB drive. Keep it offline.
2.  **Revocation Certificate**: Generate one immediately. If your key is compromised, you publish this certificate to tell the world "Do not trust this key anymore".

**Kleopatra Interface:**
*   **Certify**: When you import a friend's key, "Certify" it to tell your GPG software that you trust it.
*   **Notepad**: Use the built-in notepad to draft messages and encrypt them in place.

### [ TIPS & TRICKS ]
*   **Subkeys**: Expert trick. Keep your "Master Key" offline and only use "Subkeys" on your daily laptop. If the laptop is stolen, you revoke the subkeys but keep your identity.
*   **Expiration**: Set an expiration date (e.g., 1 year) on your keys. It forces you to rotate them.
