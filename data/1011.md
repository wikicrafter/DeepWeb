<h4>Deep Web shades</h4>
<p>
Most shown differences between deep web and clear web is that they use slightly different type of links (URL on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.onion"> .Onion formats </a>) 
</p>
<p>
To show examples of deep web based websites open TorBrowser and just click next [link](https://hiddenwiki.com/) there u can see several links used by deep web based websites
</p>
<p>To say easily websites link on DarkNet looks like a simple hashed data</p>
<p>Search engines we used daily doesn't index anything from DarkWeb. For that
there are special search engines based on DarkWeb like a [DarkWeb based DuckDuckGo](https://3g2upl4pq6kufc4m.onion/), or specific different type of search engines out there like a: Torch and etc
