### The Meatspace Vulnerabilities

**Metadata (Exif Data):**
*   Images taken with a phone/camera contain GPS coordinates, camera model, and time.
*   *Anonymization*: Use **MAT2** (Metadata Anonymisation Toolkit) on Tails to scrub this before uploading ANY photo.

**Shipping hygiene (Theoretical):**
*   **Name**: Never use a fake name for a physical drop. The mail carrier knows "John Doe" doesn't live at your house. Use the name of a previous resident or your own name (Plausible Deniability).
*   **Drops**: Never order illegal items to your home address. Use a P.O. Box or a dead drop (if you are that advanced).

**Hardware Disposal:**
*   Deleting a file does nothing. You must **overwrite** it.
*   *HDD*: Drill press through the platters.
*   *SSD*: Shredding is best. Encryption keys should be wiped.

### [ TIPS & TRICKS ]
*   **Printer Dots**: Most printers print invisible yellow dots on every page that identify the printer serial number and time. Do not print threats.
*   **Sleep Schedule**: Intelligence agencies correlate user activity times. If you post on the darknet only during "Moscow working hours," they know where you are.
