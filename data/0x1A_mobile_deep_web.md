### Mobile OpSec: A Dangerous Game

**The Risk Profile:**
Smartphones are essentially tracking beacons. They have GPS, microphones, cameras, and baseband processors (cellular modems) that operate independently of the OS.
*   **Android**: Google collects data constantly unless de-googled (GrapheneOS).
*   **iOS**: Apple's "Walled Garden" restricts what Tor can do. Firefox (and Tor Browser) on iOS is forced to use Apple's WebKit engine, which has different vulnerabilities.

**If You MUST Use Mobile:**
1.  **Android**: Use **Tor Browser for Android** (Official).
    *   *Alternative*: **Orbot** (VPN mode for other apps).
2.  **iOS**: Use **Onion Browser** (Mike Tigas).
    *   *Warning*: iOS WebKit renders JS differently. It is less secure than desktop.

### [ TIPS & TRICKS ]
*   **Faraday Bags**: If you are transporting a phone to a sensitive location, put it in a Faraday bag to block all signals (Cell, WiFi, BT, GPS).
*   **Burner Phones**: Buy a cheap Android with cash. Use it only on public WiFi. Never insert a SIM card linked to your ID.
