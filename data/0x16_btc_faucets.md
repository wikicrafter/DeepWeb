### Earning Satoshis (Why it's probably not worth it)

**Concept:**
A "Faucet" gives you crumbs of crypto for viewing ads. It was useful in 2010 when they gave out 5 BTC completely free. Now?

**The Math:**
*   Payout: ~5 Satoshis per hour.
*   1 Satoshi: $0.0006 (approx).
*   Hourly Wage: $0.003
*   **Result**: You are working for fractions of a penny.

**Why do they exist?**
To show you gambling ads. They hop you will take your $1 earnings and lose it in their "Hi-Lo" dice game.

### [ TIPS & TRICKS ]
*   **Referrals**: The only way to make money on faucets is to refer 1,000 other people. Only the "Pyramid Top" eats.
*   **Privacy Risk**: Many require an email. Use a burner. Do not link it to your real identity.
