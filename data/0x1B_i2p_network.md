### The Invisible Internet Project (I2P)

**Tor vs I2P:**
*   **Tor**: Designed for accessing the clear web anonymously (Outproxies). Traffic flows in circuits.
*   **I2P**: Designed for "Hidden Services" (Eepsites) inside the network. Traffic flows in "tunnels". It is faster for peer-to-peer (Torrents) and often more resilient to DDoS.

**Accessing I2P:**
1.  **Java I2P**: The official client. Heavy but feature-rich.
2.  **i2pd**: C++ client. Lightweight and fast.
3.  **Browser Setup**: You must configure your browser (Firefox) to use the HTTP Proxy `127.0.0.1:4444`.

**Addressing:**
*   Addresses end in `.i2p`.
*   They are bookmarked in an "Address Book". You often need a "Helper" to find new sites.

### [ TIPS & TRICKS ]
*   **Stormy Cloud**: When Tor is under heavy DDoS attack (which happens often), markets migrate to I2P. Learning I2P *before* the emergency is smart.
*   **Torrents**: You CAN torrent on I2P (unlike Tor). Use the "Snark" client.
