### Selection Criteria

**Classes of Wallets:**
1.  **Custodial (BAD)**: Coinbase, Binance, PayPal. They hold the keys. They can freeze your funds.
2.  **App/Software (GOOD)**: Electrum, Cake Wallet. You hold the keys (Seed Phrase).
3.  **Hardware (BEST)**: Trezor, Ledger. Keys never touch the internet.

**The Seed Phrase:**
*   A list of 12 or 24 words.
*   **Anyone who has this list OWNS your money.**
*   Never type it into a computer unless you are recovering a wallet. Write it on paper.

### [ TIPS & TRICKS ]
*   **Paper Wallets**: Generating a keypair offline and printing it out. Good for long term "bury in the backyard" storage.
*   **Testing**: When generating a new wallet, send a small amount ($1), delete the wallet, and try to recover it with the seed. If it works, the backup is valid.
