#### [!] Common Myths Analysis

*   **Myth: "It is Illegal to Access"**
    *   **Status**: `FALSE`
    *   **Fact**: Using Tor is legal in most countries (USA, UK, EU, etc.). However, *actions* you take (buying drugs, viewing illegal content) remain illegal regardless of the network.
    *   **Exception**: Authoritarian regimes (China, Iran, Russia) try to block Tor, though usage itself is often just "circumventing censorship".

*   **Myth: "You Will Be Hacked Instantly"**
    *   **Status**: `FALSE`
    *   **Fact**: Tor Browser is just Firefox with security patches. Unless you download and run a shady `.exe` or enable JavaScript on a malicious site, you are relatively safe.
    *   **Risk**: Phishing is the real danger, not "magic hackers".

*   **Myth: "Red Rooms (Live Torture Streams)"**
    *   **Status**: `HOAX`
    *   **Technical Limit**: The Tor network has high latency (lag). Sending a high-quality live video stream over 3 encrypted hops to thousands of viewers is technically impossible.
    *   **Reality**: These sites are scams designed to steal Bitcoin from gullible edgelords.

*   **Myth: "Mariana Web"**
    *   **Status**: `HOAX`
    *   **Fact**: An old internet creepypasta claiming a level of the web accessible only via "Polymeric Falcighol Derivation" (nonsense) and Quantum Computers. It does not exist.

*   **Myth: "Hitmen for Hire"**
    *   **Status**: `99.9% SCAM`
    *   **Fact**: Almost all "Hitman" sites are honey pots run by law enforcement or scammers. Real organized crime does not use public .onion sites for this.

### [ TIPS & TRICKS ]
*   **Trust Nothing**: Assume every "service" demanding upfront Bitcoin is a scam.
*   **Verify signatures**: If a site claims to be a famous market, verify its PGP signature. Phishing sites look identical to real ones.
