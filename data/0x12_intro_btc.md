### Currency of the Deep Web: Bitcoin (BTC) & Monero (XMR)

**The Great Misconception:**
Everyone thinks Bitcoin is anonymous. **It is NOT.**
*   **Bitcoin (BTC)**: Pseudonymous. Every transaction is public record. If your ID is linked to one address, your entire history is exposed.
*   **Monero (XMR)**: Anonymous. It uses Ring Signatures and Stealth Addresses to hide the sender, receiver, and amount.

**Why XMR is the Standard:**
Most competent markets now accept (or mandate) Monero because it protects both the vendor and the buyer from "Chain Analysis" companies.

### [ TIPS & TRICKS ]
*   **The Golden Rule**: Convert `Fiat -> BTC -> XMR`. Never send BTC directly from an exchange (Coinbase) to a Market. You will get banned by Coinbase and tracked by law enforcement.
*   **Atomic Swaps**: Use decentralized atomic swaps or non-KYC exchanges (like eXch or MajesticBank) to swap BTC for XMR.
